# COVID-19 Colleges
## About
This repository contains data on case numbers and geographical locations of COVID-19 on college campuses in the United States from 2020-2021. It also contains a subset of data for only colleges residing in the state of North Carolina.

## What is the Purpose of this Repository?
* The purpose of this repository is to provide information on how college campuses across the nation of the United States were impacted by COVID-19.
* The subset provides data representing how COVID-19 specifically impacted college campuses that are in North Carolina.

## What is this Repository/Data Used for?
* This dataset may be used for those who seek information on the amount of COVID-19 cases found on both public and private university campuses in the United States between the years 2020-2021.
*  The dataset contains information on the total cases reported in each respected campus during this timeframe as well as data containing only the number of cases reported during the year 2021 which could be used for comparison or analysis.
*   Individuals could use this data to conduct research on what areas or regions in the United States or North Carolina are most and/or least prone to be affected by COVID-19.

## Where is this Data From?
This data is a `.csv` file from the "nytimes covid-19-data colleges" github page which can be located on this [website](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/colleges) or by directly clicking on this [link](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/colleges/colleges.csv).
> The data found on the website does not provide the subset of data that is created in this repository. A seperate file on this repository will direct you through the steps neccessary in order to create your own subset.

## Getting Started
To begin following this repository, first click the "Documentation" folder and then click on the "Creating a Subset.ipynb" file. This file will open up a document that will direct you on how to use **Python3** in **Google Colabs** that will allow you to download and import the data you need. Follow along to create your own subset of the data located in this repository.
> If you want to be able to describe your own process in creating data, or use text cells in general, I recommend using [markdown](https://markdownlivepreview.com/). It will provide you with a basic, elementary level guide on how to use different codes in markdown and implement them in your text cells.

## Need Help?
* If you are confused on how Github works or what Github is in general, you can use this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) that will provide you with a in-detail description on what Github is, how to use it, creating an account, and more!
* If you get lost in the repository, I recommend using the folders and files located on the left side of the website. Each folder has its own README file that provides a short description on what the folder contains.
* If you are trying to replicate the subset found in this dataset, or are having trouble with **Google Colabs** and **Python3** then I recommened you refer to the "Creating a Subset.ipynb" file. This file will guide you through **Google Colabs** step by step on how to use **Python3** to create your own subset.

## Maintenance
* This repository is being contributed to and maintained by Dawson Coley. A student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The raw data from the original source is no longer being updated, but this repository is being kept up to date by Dawson Coley.
